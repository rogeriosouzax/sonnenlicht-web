<p>Since I was a child I was already very curious. I was always interested in understanding how things worked and why they worked that way, but I had never seen a computer before.</p>

<p>The first time I saw a computer I was around 12 years old, it was in a presentation at the school, where a company of computer courses was giving a presentation to the students about that incredible machine called the computer. At that time, having a computer at home was an inaccessible privilege for low-income people in my country.</p>

<p>After much insistence, I managed to get my mother to enroll me in the course that at the time cost a very expensive 10 reais (US$ 2.00) per month, the course was coordinated by the union of rural producers in the region. Little did she know that this would be one of the most important investments she would be making for my future. Since then, I was increasingly interested in learning about programming and technology in general. Knowing how the software worked, where the information was stored and how it could help companies and the community to develop ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>I decided to go to high school during the night so I could work during the day to save money for college. Right after I finished high school, I started college in the Systems Analysis and Development major (and continued working full time during the day). In the third semester of the course I got a full scholarship that came at a good time.</p>

<p>Before completing my course, in the last semester (fifth semester) have an opportunity to compete and be successful in the selection process of one of the largest companies in the field of cleaning and personal hygiene products in my country. Where I started as a junior analyst and worked for almost 10 years, leaving a company as a senior analyst to follow my dream of having my own business as an IT consultant.</p>
